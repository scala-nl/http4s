# v0.17.0 (2017-09-01)
* Honor `Retry-After` header in `Retry` middleware.  The response will
  not be retried until the maximum of the backoff strategy and any
  time specified by the `Retry-After` header of the response.
* The `RetryPolicy.defaultRetriable` only works for methods guaranteed
  to not have a body.  In fs2, we can't introspect the stream to
  guarantee that it can be rerun.  To retry requests for idempotent
  request methods, use `RetryPolicy.unsafeRetriable`.  To retry
  requests regardless of method, use
  `RetryPolicy.recklesslyRetriable`.
* Fix `Logger` middleware to render JSON bodies as text, not as a hex
  dump.
* `MultipartParser.parse` returns a stream of `ByteVector` instead of
  a stream of `Byte`. This perserves chunking when parsing into the
  high-level `EntityDecoder[Multipart]`, and substantially improves
  performance on large files.  The high-level API is not affected.

# v0.16.0 (2017-09-01)
* `Retry` middleware takes a `RetryPolicy` instead of a backoff
  strategy.  A `RetryPolicy` is a function of the request, the
  response, and the number of attempts.  Wrap the previous `backoff`
  in `RetryPolicy {}` for compatible behavior.
* Expose a `Part.fileData` constructor that accepts an `EntityBody`.

# v0.17.0-RC3 (2017-08-29)
* In blaze-server, when doing chunked transfer encoding, flush the
  header as soon as it is available.  It previously buffered until the
  first chunk was available.

# v0.16.0-RC3 (2017-08-29)
* Add a `responseHeaderTimeout` property to `BlazeClientConfig`.  This
  measures the time between the completion of writing the request body
  to the reception of a complete response header.
* Upgraded dependencies:
    * async-http-client-2.0.35

# v0.18.0-M1 (2107-08-24)

This release is the product of a long period of parallel development
across different foundation libraries, making a detailed changelog
difficult.  This is a living document, so if any important points are
missed here, please send a PR.

The most important change in http4s-0.18 is that the effect type is
parameterized.  Where previous versions were specialized on
`scalaz.concurrent.Task` or `fs2.Task`, this version supports anything
with a `cats.effect.Effect` instance.  The easiest way to port an
existing service is to replace your `Task` with `cats.effect.IO`,
which has a similar API and is already available on your classpath.
If you prefer to bring your own effect, such as `monix.eval.Task` or
stick to `scalaz.concurrent.Task` or put a transformer on `IO`, that's
fine, too!

The parameterization chanages many core signatures throughout http4s:
- `Request` and `Response` become `Request[F[_]]` and
  `Response[F[_]]`.  The `F` is the effect type of the body (i.e.,
  `Stream[F, Byte]`), or what the body `.run`s to.
- `HttpService` becomes `HttpService[F[_]]`, so that the service
  returns an `F[Response[F]]`.  Instead of constructing with
  `HttpService { ... }`, we now declare the effect type of the
  service, like `HttpService[IO] { ... }`.  This determines the type
  of request and response handled by the service.
- `EntityEncoder[A]` and `EntityDecoder[A]` are now
  `EntityEncoder[F[_], A]` and `EntityDecoder[F[_], A]`, respectively.
  These act as a codec for `Request[F]` and `Response[F]`.  In practice,
  this change tends to be transparent in the DSL.
- The server builders now take an `F` parameter, which needs to match
  the services mounted to them.
- The client now takes an `F` parameter, which determines the requests
  and responses it handles.

Several dependencies are upgraded:
- cats-1.0.0.MF
- circe-0.9.0-M1
- fs2-0.10.0-M6
- fs2-reactive-streams-0.2.2
- jawn-fs2-0.12.0-M1

# v0.17.0-RC2 (2017-08-24)
* Remove `ServiceSyntax.orNotFound(a: A): Task[Response]` in favor of
  `ServiceSyntax.orNotFound: Service[Request, Response]`

# v0.16.0-RC2 (2017-08-24)
* Move http4s-blaze-core from `org.http4s.blaze` to
  `org.http4s.blazecore` to avoid a conflict with the non-http4s
  blaze-core module.
* Change `ServiceOps` to operate on a `Service[?, MaybeResponse]`.
  Give it an `orNotFound` that returns a `Service`.  The
  `orNotFound(a: A)` overload is left for compatibility with Scala
  2.10.
* Build with Lightbend compiler instead of Typelevel compiler so we
  don't expose `org.typelevel` dependencies that are incompatible with
  ntheir counterparts in `org.scala-lang`.
* Upgraded dependencies:
    * blaze-0.12.7 (fixes eviction notice in http4s-websocket)
    * twirl-1.3.4

# v0.17.0-RC1 (2017-08-16)
* Port `ChunkAggregator` to fs2
* Add logging middleware
* Standardize on `ExecutionContext` over `Strategy` and `ExecutorService`
* Implement `Age` header
* Fix `Client#toHttpService` to not dispose until the body is consumed
* Add a buffered implementation of `EntityDecoder[Multipart]`
* In async-http-client, don't use `ReactiveStreamsBodyGenerator` unless there is
  a body to transmit. This fixes an `IllegalStateException: unexpected message
  type`
* Add `HSTS` middleware
* Add option to serve pre-gzipped resources
* Add RequestLogging and ResponseLogging middlewares
* `StaticFile` options return `OptionT[Task, ?]`
* Set `Content-Length` or `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header when serving
  from a URL
* Explicitly close `URLConnection``s if we are not reading the contents
* Upgrade to:
    * async-http-client-2.0.34
    * fs2-0.9.7
    * metrics-core-3.2.4
    * scodec-bits-1.1.5

# v0.16.0-RC1 (2017-08-16)
* Remove laziness from `ArbitraryInstances`
* Support an arbitrary predicate for CORS allowed origins
* Support `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` header for CORS
* Fix thread safety issue in `EntityDecoder[XML]`
* Support IPV6 headers in `X-Forwarded-For`
* Add `status` and `successful` methods to client
* Overload `client.fetchAs` and `client.streaming` to accept a `Task[Request]`
* Replace `Instant` with `HttpDate` to avoid silent truncation and constrain
  to dates that are legally renderable in HTTP.
* Fix bug in hash code of `CaseInsensitiveString`
* Update `request.pathInfo` when changing `request.withUri`. To keep these
  values in sync, `request.copy` has been deprecated, but copy constructors
  based on `with` have been added.
* Remove `name` from `AttributeKey`.
* Add `withFragment` and `withoutFragment` to `Uri`
* Construct `Content-Length` with `fromLong` to ensure validity, and
  `unsafeFromLong` when you can assert that it's positive.
* Add missing instances to `QueryParamDecoder` and `QueryParamEncoder`.
* Add `response.cookies` method to get a list of cookies from `Set-Cookie`
  header.  `Set-Cookie` is no longer a `Header.Extractable`, as it does
  not adhere to the HTTP spec of being concatenable by commas without
  changing semantics.
* Make servlet `HttpSession` available as a request attribute in servlet
  backends
* Fix `Part.name` to return the name from the `Content-Disposition` header
  instead of the name _of_ the `Content-Disposition` header. Accordingly, it is
  no longer a `CaseInsensitiveString`
* `Request.toString` and `Response.toString` now redact sensitive headers. A
  method to redact arbitrary headers is added to `Headers`.
* `Retry-After` is now modeled as a `Either[HttpDate, Long]` to reflect either
  an http-date or delta-seconds value.
* Look for index.html in `StaticFile` when rendering a directory instead of
  returning `401 Unauthorized`.
* Limit dates to a minimum of January 1, 1900, per RFC.
* Add `serviceErrorHandler` to `ServerBuilder` to allow pluggable error handlers
  when a server backend receives a failed task or a thrown Exception when
  invoking a service. The default calls `toHttpResponse` on `MessageFailure` and
  closes the connection with a `500 InternalServerError` on other non-fatal
  errors.  Fatal errors are left to the server.
* `FollowRedirect` does not propagate sensitive headers when redirecting to a
  different authority.
* Add Content-Length header to empty response generators
* Upgraded dependencies:
    * async-http-client-2.0.34
    * http4s-websocket-0.2.0
    * jetty-9.4.6.v20170531
    * json4s-3.5.3
    * log4s-1.3.6
    * metrics-core-3.2.3
    * scala-2.12.3-bin-typelevel-4
    * scalaz-7.2.15
    * tomcat-8.5.20

# v0.15.16 (2017-07-20)
* Backport rendering of details in `ParseFailure.getMessage`

# ~~v0.15.15 (2017-07-20)~~
* Oops. Same as v0.15.14.

# v0.15.14 (2017-07-10)
* Close parens in `Request.toString`
* Use "message" instead of "request" in message body failure messages
* Add `problem+json` media type
* Tolerate `[` and `]` in queries parsing URIs. These characters are parsed, but
  percent-encoded.

# v0.17.0-M3 (2017-05-27)
* Fix file corruption issue when serving static files from the classpath

# v0.16.0-M3 (2017-05-25)
* Fix `WebjarService` so it matches assets.
* `ServerApp` overrides `process` to leave a single abstract method
* Add gzip trailer in `GZip` middleware
* Upgraded dependencies:
    * circe-0.8.0
    * jetty-9.4.5.v20170502
    * scalaz-7.2.13
    * tomcat-8.5.15
* `ProcessApp` uses a `Process[Task, Nothing]` rather than a
  `Process[Task, Unit]`
* `Credentials` is split into `Credentials.AuthParams` for key-value pairs and
  `Credentials.Token` for legacy token-based schemes.  `OAuthBearerToken` is
  subsumed by `Credentials.Token`.  `BasicCredentials` no longer extends
  `Credentials`, but is extractable from one.  This model permits the
  definition of other arbitrary credential schemes.
* Add `fromSeq` constructor to `UrlForm`
* Allow `WebjarService` to pass on methods other than `GET`.  It previously
  threw a `MatchError`.

# v0.15.13 (2017-05-25)
* Patch-level upgrades to dependencies:
    * async-http-client-2.0.32
    * blaze-0.12.6 (fixes infinite loop in some SSL handshakes)
    * jetty-9.3.19.v20170502
    * json4s-3.5.2
    * tomcat-8.0.44

# v0.15.12 (2017-05-11)
* Fix GZip middleware to render a correct stream

# v0.17.0-M2 (2017-04-30)
* `Timeout` middleware takes an implicit `Scheduler` and
  `ExecutionContext`
* Bring back `http4s-async-client`, based on `fs2-reactive-stream`
* Restore support for WebSockets

# v0.16.0-M2 (2017-04-30)
* Upgraded dependencies:
    * argonaut-6.2
    * jetty-9.4.4.v20170414
    * tomcat-8.5.14
* Fix `ProcessApp` to terminate on process errors
* Set `secure` request attribute correctly in blaze server
* Exit with code `-1` when `ProcessApp` fails
* Make `ResourceService` respect `If-Modified-Since`
* Rename `ProcessApp.main` to `ProcessApp.process` to avoid overload confusio
* Avoid intermediate String allocation in Circe's `jsonEncoder`
* Adaptive EntityDecoder[Json] for circe: works directly from a ByteBuffer for
  small bodies, and incrementally through jawn for larger.
* Capture more context in detail message of parse errors

# v0.15.11 (2017-04-29)
* Upgrade to blaze-0.12.5 to pick up fix for `StackOverflowError` in
  SSL handshake

# v0.15.10 (2017-04-28)
* Patch-level upgrades to dependencies
* argonaut-6.2
* scalaz-7.2.12
* Allow preambles and epilogues in multipart bodies
* Limit multipart headers to 40 kilobytes to avoid unbounded buffering
  of long lines in a header
* Remove `' '` and `'?'` from alphabet for generated multipart
  boundaries, as these are not token characters and are known to cause
  trouble for some multipart implementations
* Fix multipart parsing for unlucky input chunk sizes

# v0.15.9 (2017-04-19)
* Terminate `ServerApp` even if the server fails to start
* Make `ResourceService` respect `If-Modified-Since`
* Patch-level upgrades to dependencies:
* async-http-client-2.0.31
* jetty-9.3.18.v20170406
* json4s-3.5.1
* log4s-1.3.4
* metrics-core-3.1.4
* scalacheck-1.13.5
* scalaz-7.1.13 or scalaz-7.2.11
* tomcat-8.0.43

# v0.17.0-M1 (2017-04-08)
* First release on cats and fs2
    * All scalaz types and typeclasses replaced by cats equivalengts
	* `scalaz.concurrent.Task` replaced by `fs2.Task`	
	* `scalaz.stream.Process` replaced by `fs2.Stream`
* Roughly at feature parity with v0.16.0-M1. Notable exceptions:
	* Multipart not yet supported
	* Web sockets not yet supported
	* Client retry middleware can't check idempotence of requests
	* Utilties in `org.http4s.util.io` not yet ported

# v0.16.0-M1 (2017-04-08)
* Fix type of `AuthedService.empty`
* Eliminate `Fallthrough` typeclass.  An `HttpService` now returns
  `MaybeResponse`, which can be a `Response` or `Pass`.  There is a
  `Semigroup[MaybeResponse]` instance that allows `HttpService`s to be
  chained as a semigroup.  `service orElse anotherService` is
  deprecated in favor of `service |+| anotherService`.
* Support configuring blaze and Jetty servers with a custom
  `SSLContext`.
* Upgraded dependencies for various modules:
    * async-http-client-2.0.31
    * circe-0.7.1
    * jetty-9.4.3.v20170317
    * json4s-3.5.1
    * logback-1.2.1
    * log4s-1.3.4
    * metrics-3.2.0
    * scalacheck-1.13.5
    * tomcat-8.0.43
* Deprecate `EntityEncoder[ByteBuffer]` and
  `EntityEncoder[CharBuffer]`.
* Add `EntityDecoder[Unit]`.
* Move `ResponseClass`es into `Status`.
* Use `SSLContext.getDefault` by default in blaze-client.  Use
  `BlazeServerConfig.insecure` to ignore certificate validity.  But
  please don't.
* Move `CaseInsensitiveString` syntax to `org.http4s.syntax`.
* Bundle an internal version of parboiled2.  This decouples core from
  shapeless, allowing applications to use their preferred version of
  shapeless.
* Rename `endpointAuthentication` to `checkEndpointAuthentication`.
* Add a `WebjarService` for serving files out of web jars.
* Implement `Retry-After` header.
* Stop building with `delambdafy` on Scala 2.11.
* Eliminate finalizer on `BlazeConnection`.
* Respond OK to CORS pre-flight requests even if the wrapped service
  does not return a successful response.  This is to allow `CORS`
  pre-flight checks of authenticated services.
* Deprecate `ServerApp` in favor of `org.http4s.util.ProcessApp`.  A
  `ProcessApp` is easier to compose all the resources a server needs via
  `Process.bracket`.
* Implement a `Referer` header.

# v0.15.8 (2017-04-06)
* Cache charset lookups to avoid synchronization.  Resolution of
  charsets is synchronized, with a cache size of two.  This avoids
  the synchronized call on the HTTP pool.
* Strip fragment from request target in blaze-client.  An HTTP request
  target should not include the fragment, and certain servers respond
  with a `400 Bad Request` in their presence.

# v0.15.7 (2017-03-09)
* Change default server and client executors to a minimum of four
  threads.
* Bring scofflaw async-http-client to justice for its brazen
  violations of Reactive Streams Rule 3.16, requesting of a null
  subscription.
* Destroy Tomcat instances after stopping, so they don't hold the port
* Deprecate `ArbitraryInstances.genCharsetRangeNoQuality`, which can
  cause deadlocks
* Patch-level upgrades to dependencies:
    * async-http-client-2.0.30
    * jetty-9.3.16.v20170120
    * logback-1.1.11
    * metrics-3.1.3
    * scala-xml-1.0.6
    * scalaz-7.2.9
    * tomcat-8.0.41
    * twirl-1.2.1

# v0.15.6 (2017-03-03)
* Log unhandled MessageFailures to `org.http4s.server.message-failures`

# v0.15.5 (2017-02-20)
* Allow services wrapped in CORS middleware to fall through
* Don't log message about invalid CORS headers when no `Origin` header present
* Soften log about invalid CORS headers from info to debug

# v0.15.4 (2017-02-12)
* Call `toHttpResponse` on tasks failed with `MessageFailure`s from
  `HttpService`, to get proper 4xx handling instead of an internal
  server error.

# v0.15.3 (2017-01-17)
* Dispose of redirect responses in `FollowRedirect`. Fixes client deadlock under heavy load
* Refrain from logging headers with potentially sensitive info in blaze-client
* Add `hashCode` and `equals` to `Headers`
* Make `challenge` in auth middlewares public to facilitate composing multiple auth mechanisms
* Fix blaze-client detection of stale connections

# v0.15.2 (2016-12-29)
* Add helpers to add cookies to requests

# v0.12.6 (2016-12-29)
* Backport rendering of details in `ParseFailure.getMessage`

# ~~v0.12.5 (2016-12-29)~~
* ~~Backport rendering of details in `ParseFailure.getMessage`~~ Oops.

# v0.15.1 (2016-12-20)

* Eliminate response attribute for detecting fallthrough response.
  The fallthrough response must be `Response.fallthrough`.
* Encode URI path segments created with `/`
* Introduce `AuthedRequest` and `AuthedService` types.
* Replace `CharSequenceEncoder` with `CharBufferEncoder`, assuming
  that `CharBuffer` and `String` are the only `CharSequence`s one
  would want to encode.
* Remove `EnittyEncoder[Char]` and `EntityEncoder[Byte]`.  Send an
  array, buffer, or String if you want this.
* Add `DefaultHead` middleware for `HEAD` implementation.
* Decouple `http4s-server` from Dropwizard Metrics.  Metrics code is
  in the new `http4s-metrics` module.
* Allow custom scheduler for timeout middleware.
* Add parametric empty `EntityEncoder` and `EntityEncoder[Unit]`.
* Replace unlawful `Order[CharsetRange]` with `Equal[CharsetRange]`.
* Auth middlewares renamed `BasicAuth` and `DigestAuth`.
* `BasicAuth` passes client password to store instead of requesting
  password from store.
* Remove realm as an argument to the basic and digest auth stores.
* Basic and digest auth stores return a parameterized type instead of
  just a String username.
* Upgrade to argonaut-6.2-RC2, circe-0.6.1, json4s-3.5.0

# v0.14.11 (2016-10-25)
* Fix expansion of `uri` and `q` macros by qualifying with `_root_`

# v0.14.10 (2016-10-12)
